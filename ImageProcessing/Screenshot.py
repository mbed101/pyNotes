# To capture a screenshot in Python, you can use the PIL (Python Imaging Library) or its fork, Pillow. Here's an example using Pillow:

# First, make sure you have Pillow installed. You can install it using pip:
# pip install pillow
# Once installed, you can use the following code to capture a screenshot:

from PIL import ImageGrab

# Capture the entire screen
screenshot = ImageGrab.grab()

# Save the screenshot to a file
screenshot.save("screenshot.png")

#The ImageGrab.grab() function captures the entire screen. You can also specify a specific region to capture by passing coordinates as a tuple, like ImageGrab.grab(bbox=(x1, y1, x2, y2)), where (x1, y1) is the top-left coordinate and (x2, y2) is the bottom-right coordinate of the region.
